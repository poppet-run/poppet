# Chat

[Documentation index](index.md)

## Start and continue a session

After signing in and choosing a model, start a session:

```fish
set -lx POPPET_PROVIDER openai-chatgpt
set -lx POPPET_MODEL gpt-6.1-sol
bun run start chat new "Help me plan a small TypeScript project"
bun run start chat sessions
```

The answer streams to stdout. The session and run IDs print to stderr. Copy the
session ID to continue or inspect it in a later invocation:

```fish
set session_id 'paste-session-id-here'
bun run start chat send $session_id "What should I build first?"
bun run start chat show $session_id
```

Each invocation sends one message. `chat sessions` lists saved sessions;
`chat show` prints the session, ordered messages, run states, failures, output,
and usage as JSON. Opaque provider continuation is retained privately in SQLite
and omitted from this display. Inspection needs no selected model or login.

## Provider and model selection

New sessions use `POPPET_PROVIDER` and the required `POPPET_MODEL`. Existing
sessions keep their saved provider, model, and workload when configuration
changes. Start a new session to change that selection. OpenCode Go requires a
coding session:

```fish
set -lx POPPET_PROVIDER opencode-go
set -lx POPPET_MODEL glm-5.3
bun run start chat new --coding "Explain how to structure a TypeScript CLI"
```

## Failures and cancellation

Poppet saves each input before resolving its model. Only an authoritative
completed response becomes a saved answer. Provider failures, context errors,
Ctrl-C, closed output, and deadlines leave inspectable failed or interrupted
runs. Partial output may already be visible in the terminal but is not saved as
an answer. Failed inputs remain visible and are excluded from subsequent model
context; sending another message is an explicit new request. Requests are never
automatically retried or switched to another provider/model.

## Context and run limits

Context retains recent complete exchanges, including tool pairs and continuation,
up to the configured turn and byte budgets. When model capacity is known,
Poppet also reserves room for output and request overhead. UTF-8 bytes are a
conservative estimate rather than an exact tokenizer; providers can still reject
oversized context. A new message that cannot fit fails clearly. Trimming changes
only the request, not saved history. Answers are limited to 128 KiB of text and
1 MiB including continuation. The runner has a 90-second absolute deadline;
provider inference also retains its 60-second deadline.

Tool-capable models receive the three [notes tools](notes.md). Models without tool
support continue to answer text requests. The runner checks complete tool
requests before execution and keeps one provider/model throughout the exchange.
Recorded usage sums all model turns when every turn reports usage, otherwise it
is null. Live account chat remains a manual check and consumes provider usage.

See [worker](worker.md#interactive-commands) for chat while a worker is running.
